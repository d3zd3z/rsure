# Changelog

## Release 0.8.2

This is a minor release with some minor improvements, mostly having to
do with moving to Rust 2018.  As of this release, Rust 2018 is
required to build Rsure.

In addition to the 2018 changes, this release also makes some
improvements to the progress meter.  If the client of the library uses
`log_init` to initialize the logging system, the progress meter will
cooperate with the logging system to present a clean, and frequently
updated message.  Otherwise, the meter will remain as before, only
updated ever 5 seconds.

This also adds a separate progress meter to indicate the status of the
initial filesystem scan.  With large trees, this scan can take some
time, and the meter is a useful indicator of what is happening.

## Release 0.8.1

This is a minor release that updates the versions of child dependencies.

## Release 0.8

Release 0.8 of rsure makes some notable changes to the library and
commandline tool.  The most significant change is that the 'weave'
format is the primary format that deltas are stored in.  Instead of
distinguishing the old files by 2sure.weave.gz and 2sure.dat.gz, weave
files are just called 2sure.dat.gz.  It may be possible to add format
detection to detect the old format, but I suspect there isn't a lot of
use of these files anyway.

Other changes:
- Move to 'failure' instead of 'error-chain'.
- Bump many dependencies.
