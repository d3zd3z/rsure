# Changelog

## Release 0.8.1

This is a minor release that updates the versions of child dependencies.

## Release 0.8

Release 0.8 of rsure makes some notable changes to the library and
commandline tool.  The most significant change is that the 'weave'
format is the primary format that deltas are stored in.  Instead of
distinguishing the old files by 2sure.weave.gz and 2sure.dat.gz, weave
files are just called 2sure.dat.gz.  It may be possible to add format
detection to detect the old format, but I suspect there isn't a lot of
use of these files anyway.

Other changes:
- Move to 'failure' instead of 'error-chain'.
- Bump many dependencies.
